---

## Task 5 – Stash, Cherry-Pick & Tags

### Objective

---

## Task 6 – Clean History, Conflicts & Undoing Changes

### Objective
Learn to clean commits and safely undo mistakes.

### What You Need to Do
- Squash multiple commits into one
- Create and resolve merge conflicts:
  - Same file same line
  - Same file different line
- Resolve conflicts manually
- Use:
  - `git revert`
  - `git reset --soft`
  - `git reset --mixed`
  - `git reset --hard`
- Explain when each should be used

### Deliverables
- Conflict resolution proof
- Squashed commit history
- Reset/revert outputs

### Interview Connect
Be ready to answer:
- Difference between revert and reset?
- How do you handle merge conflicts?

---

## Task 7 – Git Errors & Corporate Branching Strategy

### Objective
Handle real-world Git problems and follow corporate workflows.

### What You Need to Do
- Simulate and fix:
  - Detached HEAD state
  - Non-fast-forward error
  - Pull failure due to divergence
- Explain and demonstrate:

  - Release branching
  - Hotfix branching
- Explain:
  - Branch protection
  - PR-based merges
  - Versioned releases

### Deliverables
